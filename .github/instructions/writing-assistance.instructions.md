# Writing Assistance — Design & Architecture

Writing assistance is a friendly, non-judgmental helper that quietly reviews what the user types and offers suggestions. It must never feel like error correction — it's a learning companion.

> **⚠️ IT (Interactive Translation) is deprecated.** Do not add new IT functionality. Translation will become a match type within IGC.

## Design Intent

### Core Principle: Helper, Not Judge

Playtest feedback consistently shows users perceive writing corrections as errors or punishments. The redesign addresses this by:

1. **Removing all accept/reject language** — no "Ignore" or "Replace" buttons. The user simply views suggestions and optionally taps a choice.
2. **Using warm, varied colors** — each match type gets a distinct, fun color (not red/orange "error" tones). Colors signal category, not severity.
3. **Making interaction optional** — viewing a suggestion is enough. The user can send their message at any point, even with unviewed suggestions.
4. **Reusing a single popup** — one persistent span card that updates its content as the user navigates between matches, eliminating the jitter of opening/closing overlays.

### Target User Perception

> "Oh, my writing assistant noticed a few things. Let me take a look… ah, I see. Cool."

Not:

> "I made 3 errors and need to fix them before I can send."

## Assistance Ring (replaces StartIGCButton)

The current `StartIGCButton` is updated to display a **segmented ring**, indicating match states.

### Ring Behavior

- The ring's outer edge divides into **one segment per match** returned by the server.
- Each segment's **color** corresponds to its match's `ReplacementTypeEnum` color category.
- Segments have two opacity states:
  - **Bright (full opacity)** — match not yet viewed.
  - **Muted (low opacity)** — match has been viewed (or was auto-applied).
- **AutocorrectPopup retained** — when surface corrections are auto-applied, the existing `AutocorrectPopup` briefly appears to draw attention to the change. This ensures auto-applied edits aren't silently swallowed. The popup is the same toast-like overlay currently used.
- The ring is a **status indicator only** — tapping it does not navigate between matches. Users navigate by tapping highlighted text in the input field.

### Icon States

| State           | Icon Behavior                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Idle / no text  | Grey check icon with 5 grey segments                       |
| Fetching        | Segments spin, check is hidden                    |
| Matches present | Ring segments visible |
| Zero matches    | Check visible, **solid green ring**  |
| Input cleared   | Ring **animates out**, returns to idle          |
| Re-fetch        | Icon **spins again**, old segments cleared      |
| Error           | error indicator (TBD) |

The ring **animates in** when segments first appear and **animates out** when the input field is cleared. When the user edits text and triggers a re-fetch, the icon spins again and old segments are discarded — the new response rebuilds the ring from scratch.

### What We're Removing

- The `autorenew` spinning icon
- The elevation/shadow changes based on state

---

## Text Highlighting

Matched text in the input field uses **background highlights** (not just underlines) with the same color system as the ring segments.

### Highlight Behavior

- **Unviewed matches**: Highlighted with **bright (full opacity)** background in the match's category color.
- **Viewed matches**: Highlighted with **muted (low opacity)** background after the user has opened and navigated away from the span card for that match.
- **Accepted matches**: Text is replaced. The highlight remains bright. The user can tap it again to revisit and undo.
- **Auto-applied matches**: Text already replaced. Highlighted bright immediately.

### Color Palette

Each `ReplacementTypeEnum` category gets a distinct, friendly color. Colors should feel varied and playful — not a gradient from "fine" to "bad." Examples of the spirit (exact values TBD in implementation):

| Category             | Color Spirit      |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Grammar              | Coral / warm pink |
| Word choice          | Sky blue          |
| Style / fluency      | Lavender          |
| Surface (auto-apply) | Mint green        |
| Translation          | Amber             |

---

## Span Card (Redesigned)

A single, persistent popup that changes content as the user taps different highlighted matches. No open/close animation between matches — the card stays in place and its content transitions smoothly.

### Positioning

The card positions itself relative to the currently selected match's highlighted text. When the user taps a different match, the card **animates smoothly** to the new position (slide + content crossfade) rather than jumping. The animation should feel fluid and natural — not snapping or teleporting. If the message is short and all highlights are close together, the movement will be subtle. For long messages where highlights are far apart, the card glides to follow.

### Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✕       Edit Category Title   🚩 │  ← Header: close, category name (e.g. "Verb Conjugation"), flag
│                                 │
│  🤖  Hint text explaining the   │  ← Bot face left-aligned, hint text beside it
│      suggestion in detail       │
│                                 │
│  ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐    │  ← Choices: horizontal if they fit,
│  │ word │ │ word │ │ undo │    │     vertical if not. Undo action at end.
│  └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**When revisiting an already-accepted match**, the choices row is replaced with a compact diff view:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✕       Edit Category Title   🚩 │
│                                 │
│  🤖  Hint text                   │
│                                 │
│  original → replacement    ↩    │  ← Shows what changed + undo icon
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Interaction Model

1. **User taps highlighted text** → Span card appears (or updates content if already open) showing that match's hint and choices.
2. **User reads the suggestion** → Once they navigate away (tap different text, tap close, or tap outside), the match is marked **viewed**. Its highlight and ring segment become bright.
3. **User taps a choice** → If the choice is the best replacement, the text is replaced, the match is marked **accepted**, and the card advances to the next unviewed match (or closes if none remain). If not, the choice is marked as selected and the user gets the feedback of the color change of the choice. They can click it again to do it anyway. "alt" choices should appear as a lighter green. "distractors" should appear as red.
4. **User taps the undo action** → Reverts to the original text for that match. The match returns to `viewed` status (bright, but choices shown again instead of diff view). Undo is available per-match (not just most-recent) because **spans never overlap** — each match targets a unique, non-overlapping substring.
5. **User taps an already-accepted match's text** → Span card reopens showing `original → replacement` with an undo icon, instead of the choices row. Tapping undo reverts the text and restores the full choices view. This is identical for auto-applied matches — tapping a bright auto-applied highlight opens the same diff view with undo.
6. **User taps close (✕)** → Card closes. Match is marked viewed.

> **Open question — auto-advance viewing**: When the user accepts a choice and the card auto-advances to the next match, does that brief display count as "viewed"? Try the current behavior in practice and adjust if users feel they're missing content.

> **Open question — text re-editing**: If the user edits text after matches have been returned (e.g., types more, backspaces into a matched region), what happens to existing matches? Current behavior is to re-fetch. Consider whether partial invalidation is worth the complexity or if a full re-fetch on significant edits is acceptable.

### What We're Removing

- "Ignore in this text" button
- "Replace" button
- The entire bottom button row
- Per-match overlay creation/destruction (single reusable card instead)

### What We're Keeping

- Close button (✕)
- Bot face icon (now left-aligned next to hint text)
- Edit category as header title (e.g. "Verb Conjugation", "Word Choice")
- Flag button (feedback)
- Choices array (with responsive horizontal/vertical layout)
- Hint/explanation text

## Match Lifecycle

Matches no longer require explicit accept/ignore. The lifecycle simplifies to:

| Status      | Meaning                                                 | Ring/Highlight        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `automatic` | Auto-applied on arrival (punct, diacritics, spell, cap) | Bright immediately    |
| `open`      | Server-returned, not yet viewed                         | Muted                 |
| `viewed`    | User opened the span card and navigated away            | Bright                |
| `accepted`  | User tapped a choice, text replaced                     | Bright                |
| `undone`    | User reverted an accepted match                         | Bright (still viewed) |

The `ignored` status is removed — viewing is sufficient. The message is sendable at any point regardless of match status.

---

## Sending

The user can send at any time. There is no gate on unresolved matches.

- **Send button** remains separate from the assistance ring (to the right of it in the input row).
- On send, the choreographer tokenizes the final text and saves a `ChoreoRecordModel` with the message, recording which matches were viewed, accepted, or left open.

---

## Feedback System

Unchanged from current design. When the user taps the flag (🚩) on the span card:

- They can submit feedback text and a score (thumbs up/down maps to 10/0).
- The server audits the suggestion, escalates the model if rejected, and persists the judgment for fine-tuning.
- Native speaker approval (score 9–10) caches the response without regeneration.

---

## Match Type Categories

Categories returned by `/grammar_v2`. Each gets a distinct color in the ring and text highlights:

| Category                | Types                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Behavior                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Grammar** (~21 types) | verb conjugation/tense/mood, agreement (subject-verb, gender, number, case), article, preposition, pronoun, word order, negation, question formation, relative clause, connector, possessive, comparative, passive voice, conditional, infinitive/gerund, modal | Highlight + ring segment, user-viewable                  |
| **Surface**             | punct, diacritics, spell, cap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Auto-applied**, bright immediately, undo via span card. Hint text displayed only if server provides one (non-null) — omitted for obvious corrections, included when pedagogically useful (e.g. explaining an accent rule). |
| **Word choice**         | false cognate, L1 interference, collocation, semantic confusion                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Highlight + ring segment, user-viewable                  |
| **Style / fluency**     | style, fluency, didYouMean, transcription, translation, other                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Highlight + ring segment, user-viewable                  |

### Flow Summary

1. User types → debounce → `/grammar_v2` request
2. Response returns matches → auto-apply surface corrections, display the rest
3. Ring segments and text highlights appear (muted)
4. User taps highlights to view suggestions, optionally accepts choices
5. Viewed matches become bright
6. User sends when ready — no gate on unresolved matches
7. On send: tokenize final text, save `ChoreoRecordModel` with match history

| `/choreo/grammar_v2`            | ✅ Active — primary IGC endpoint         |
| `/choreo/tokenize`              | ✅ Active — tokenizes final text on send |
| `/choreo/span_details`          | ❌ Dead code — remove                    |
| `/choreo/it_initialstep`        | ⚠️ Deprecated — remove with IT           |
| `/choreo/contextual_definition` | ⚠️ Deprecated — remove with IT           |

## Deprecated: Interactive Translation (IT)

> **Do not extend. Scheduled for removal.**

The `it/` directory, `ITController`, and all IT-related code (`it_bar.dart`, `it_feedback_card.dart`, `word_data_card.dart`, `choreo_mode_enum.dart`) will be removed. Translation will become a match type within IGC.

---

## Future Work

- **Cycling placeholder text** in the input bar ("Type in English or Spanish…") to teach users they can write in L1 ([#5653](https://github.com/pangeachat/client/issues/5653))
- **Color palette finalization** — exact hue/opacity values for each match category
- **Ring animate in/out** — entrance animation when segments appear, exit when input cleared
- **Ring segment muted→bright transition** — per-segment animation when a match is viewed
- **Span card slide animation** — fluid positional slide + content crossfade when switching between matches
- **Accessibility badge** — small unviewed-count badge on the Pangea Chat icon
- **Analytics events** — track span card views, choice selections, and undo actions in Firebase Analytics
- **`to_replace` migration** — the current offset-based span targeting is more brittle than the server's unique `to_replace` substring system. Consider migrating the client to identify spans by `to_replace` text rather than character offsets. This is a large change because legacy span data stored in saved JSON events would need `fromJson` migration.
