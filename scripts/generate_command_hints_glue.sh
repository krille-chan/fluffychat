# Generates some glue code for translation of /command hints.

# How to use this:
# - Add any new hints to assets/l10n/intl_en.arb
#   They must be of the form commandHint_<command> with <command> in lowercase.
# - Run this script to regenerate the glue code
# - Run flutter test to see if you did everything right

# Looking to add descriptions for a new command, but don't know what it does?
# It is likely defined here (in registerDefaultCommands()):
# https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk/-/blob/main/lib/src/utils/commands_extension.dart
