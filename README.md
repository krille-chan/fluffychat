### Android

### iOS / iPadOS

* Have a Mac with Xcode installed, and set up for Xcode-managed app signing
* If you want automatic app installation to connected devices, make sure you have Apple Configurator installed, with the Automation Tools (`cfgutil`) enabled
* Set a few environment variables
    * FLUFFYCHAT_NEW_TEAM: the Apple Developer team that your certificates should live under
    * FLUFFYCHAT_NEW_GROUP: the group you want App IDs and such to live under (ie: com.example.fluffychat)

  An example can be found at `config.sample.json`. All values there are optional.
  **Please only the values, you really need**. If you e.g. only want
